# **Sentinel IOT** 

## Sentinel Hub

<br>
**The Sentinel Hub** is the main dashboard which allows the user to visualize and control all of their connected devices. Users can drag and drop arrows between individual **leaves**, which are groups of devices and sensors, in order to create a connection between two or more leaves. This connection can serve different functions including a **subscription** which enables a leaf to routinely update another on its status. Another type of connection is a **conditional connection**, which specifies how one leaf responds to changes in the status of another leaf.

## Sentinel Leaves

A **leaf** is a discrete group of one or more devices which interacts with the Sentinel Hub. A leaf consists of a variety of sensors and outputs which can take a variety of forms and data types (see [API Section](#api)). When a leaf sensor updates, it will report to the backend in one of three options: instantly, periodically (e.g. only once a second), or only when requested. 

### Arduino Leaves
This project will come with a Arduino Library that allows you to easily implement the Leaf API for your Arduino IoT device. See more on the [Arduino](arduino) page.

### Software leaves
Leaves can also be software defined rather than existing as a physical device. For example, a user may want to have a leaf which checks the weather from a website and reports it to your thermostat to change the temperature. 


## The Sentinel API
The Sentinel API enables developers to set up a Sentinel Hub and easily configure and connect leaves.

### WebSockets
WebSockets support a more dynamic interface for interacting with leaves. Simply connect to your Sentinel Hub and start sending the messages defined in the **Leaf Messages** section below. 

### HTTP Interface
This table contains the various ways to use the HTTP API to interface with your Hub. The responses will be the same as the WebSockets API (see [Hub Messages](#hubmess)). Authentication through OAuth?(need to look into that). You can also go to one of the "broader" urls (/leaves/, /devices/, /hub/) and send a JSON request identical to the WebSockets ones below.

| Name | Reciever | HTTP Method | URL |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | --- |
| Setting Set  | Hub | POST |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/config/?option=\<option\>&value=<value\> |
| Setting Get  | Hub | GET |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/config/?option=\<option\> |
| List Leaves  | Hub | GET |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/leaves/?list=1 |
| List Devices  | Leaf | GET |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/<leaf_id\>/devices/?list=1 |
| Output Set  | Leaf | POST |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/<leaf_id\>/<device_id\>/?value=<value\> |
| Sensor Get  | Leaf | GET |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/<leaf_id\>/<device_id\>/ |
| List Options | Leaf | GET |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/<leaf_id\>/config/?list=1 |
| Option Set  | Leaf | POST |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/<leaf_id\>/config/?option=<option\>&value=<value\> |
| Option Get  | Leaf | GET |  https://myhub.sentinel.iot/<hub_id\>/<leaf_id\>/config/?option=<option\> |


### Leaf Messages
These are the messages a leaf will send to a Sentinel Hub. They are JSON messages in the following form.
```
{
    'type':'[TYPE]',
    'uuid':'[UUID]',
    '[ATTR1]':'[ATTR1_VALUE]',
    '[ATTR2]':'[ATTR2_VALUE]',
    ...
}
```
Only the type and uuid attributes are required, all other attributes are specific to the type of message you are trying to send. Type defines the type of message being sent. UUID is a [unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for each leaf.

| Name | TYPE | Additional Attributes | Description | Required Uses |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Name  | NAME | name: english name of the node | The name of the device | After receiving a GET_NAME or SET_NAME message |
| Config  | CONFIG | name: english name of leaf <br> model: model number of the leaf <br> api-version: version of api| Configuration of the device. Used to register a leaf with a hub. | After connecting to a hub or recieving a GET_CONFIG message|
| List Devices  | DEVICE_LIST | devices: JSON list of all devices, their formats, and their mode (input/output) | This returns a list of sensors and all the necessary data to interface with them (see [Devices](#devices) for the form of each device) | After recieving a LIST_DEVICES message| 
| Device Status | DEVICE_STATUS | device: name of device <br> status: status of device | The status for a device will either be it's sensor value (for input devices) or it's current state (for output devices) | After recieving a SET_OUTPUT or GET_DEVICE command |
| Unknown Device | UNKNOWN_DEVICE |  device: name of unknown device | Used to respond to a request regarding a device that the leaf is not configured to accept | After recieving an invalid SET_OPTION or GET_OPTION command |
| List Options | OPTION_LIST | device: name of device list is for <br> options: list of all options and their value types | This command lists all the options available for a particular device. For leaf-wide options, the device will simply be 'leaf' | After recieving a LIST_OPTIONS message |
| Unknown Option | UNKNOWN_OPTION |  device: name of device <br> option: name of unknown option | Used to respond to a request regarding an option that a device does not have | After recieving an invalid SET_OUTPUT or GET_DEVICE command |
| Option Update  | OPTION | device: name of device <br> option: name of option <br> value: current setting of option | Gives the current value of an option for a particular device. For leaf-wide options the device will be "leaf". | After recieving a SET_OPTION or GET_OPTION message |
| Invalid Value | INVALID_VALUE |  device: name of device <br> mode: option/device <br> value: the value that was invalid | Used to respond to a request regarding an improper value for an option or output | After recieving an invalid SET_OUTPUT or SET_OPTION command |
#### Devices
This section deals with the various formats through which a device can report or receive data.
##### Device Config
When sending a list of devices each element of the list should be in the following format:
```
{
    'device':'[DEVICE_NAME]',
    'format':'[FORMAT_TYPE]',
    'mode':'[IN|OUT]',
}
```
The formats are listed below and mode must take the value of either IN or OUT.
##### Status Updates
When a device reports its status to a Sentinel Hub it will submit a message that follows the following format.
```
{
    'type':'DEVICE_STATUS',
    'uuid':'[UUID]',
    'device':'[DEVICE_NAME]'
    'format':'[FORMAT_TYPE]',
    'value':'[VALUE]',
    '[ATTR1]':'[ATTR1_VALUE]',
    '[ATTR2]':'[ATTR2_VALUE]',
    ...
}
```
##### Data formats
These are all of the currently supported data formats for leaf devices. If an unrecognized format is reported, it will default to being interpreted as a String.

| Name | JSON Representation | Description | Example |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Number | 'number' | A number | { <br> 'format':'number', <br> 'value':12345132 <br> } |
| Number with Units | 'number+units' | A number and some units | { <br> 'format':'number+units', <br> 'value':12345132, <br> units:'Â°C' <br>} |
| String | 'string' | A text string | {<br>'format':'string',<br>'value':132123<br>} |
| Boolean | 'bool' | A true/false value represented as  either a 0 or a 1 | {<br>'format':'bool',<br>'value':0<br>} |


##### Options

Options are reported to the server in the following manner:
```
{
    'option':'[OPTION_NAME]',
    'format':'[DATA_FORMAT]',
    'value':'[VALUE]',
}
```
When you send a list of options, simply send a JSON list containing multiple options in this format.

### Hub Messages
These are the messages your leaf must receive and process in order to properly interact with the Sentinel IoT hub it is connected to. The format is as follows:
```
{
    'type':'[OPTION_NAME]',
    'uuid':[UUID of Leaf],
    'hubid':[ID of Hub],
    '[ATTR1]':'[ATTR1_VALUE]',
    '[ATTR2]':'[ATTR2_VALUE]',
    ...
}
```
| Name | TYPE | Additional Attributes | Description | Required Processing |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Set Name  | SET_NAME | name: new english name of the node | Changes the default name of the leaf | The leaf should update its name and send a NAME message |
| Get Name  | GET_NAME | None | Requests the name of the leaf | The leaf should send a NAME message |
| Get Config  | GET_CONFIG | None| Requests configuration of device, usually sent on initial connection. | Send a CONFIG message|
| List Devices  | LIST_DEVICES | None | Requests a list of sensors and all the necessary data to interface with them (see [Devices](#devices) for the form of each device) | Send a  DEVICE_LIST message |
| Get Device | GET_DEVICE | device: name of device | The status for a device will either be it's sensor value (for input devices) or it's current state (for output devices) | Locate device and send DEVICE_STATUS or UNKNOWN_DEVICE message |
| Set Output | SET_OUTPUT | device: name of device <br> value: new value of output| Changes the output state, if valid, of device | Change the device's output value (or send INVALID_VALUE) and send a DEVICE_STATUS message|
| List Options | LIST_OPTIONS | device: name of device list is for | This command lists all the options available for a particular device. For leaf-wide options, the device will simply be 'leaf' | Send a OPTION_LIST message |
| Get Option  | GET_OPTION | device: name of device <br> option: name of option  | Requests the current value of an option for a particular device. For leaf-wide options the device will be "leaf". | Send an OPTION message or a UNKNOWN_DEVICE, UNKNOWN_OPTION |
| Set Option  | SET_OPTION | device: name of device <br> option: name of option <br> value: new setting of option | Changes the current value of an option for a particular device. For leaf-wide options the device will be "leaf". | Change option and send OPTION message if sucessful else send UNKNOWN_DEVICE, UNKNOWN_OPTION, or INVALID_VALUE |
## Sentinel Backend
The Sentinel Backend processes all of features and interactions defined above. In the current version of Sentinel IoT, The Sentinel is implemented in Django using Django Channels and WebSockets.

### Conditions
Conditions are logical statements that evaluate to either _true_ or _false_. There can be either one or multiple statements connected by AND, OR, NOR, NOT, XOR, XNOR, NAND, NOR, etc. Once a condition is satisfied (i.e. the whole statement is true) some code will be run. This code could set a value of another leaf, change a setting, send an alert, post a message on a social media site, or whatever else you want to program it to do. More info on this will be added later.

### WebSockets and HTTP

Currently, there are two channels for leaves to interface with the backend: WebSockets (for real-time updates) and HTTP for a more RESTful interface.
